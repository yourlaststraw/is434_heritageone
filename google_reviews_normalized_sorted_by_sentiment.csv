I visited with my friends for lunch with great excitement assuming it is authentic mangalorean (the name kudla misled us).
Ambiance is good, ppl at the restaurant kind and helpful.
We ordered mangalore goli bajje (was good) chicken ghee roast (there was hardly any ghee in it, it was pure chilli masala, the meat was frozen n tasteless), mutton sukka (average), kori rotti (abv average, again chkn meat frozen), neer dosa (average), butter milk (good),& pepper panner (good).
The price range is ok but calling it as authentic Mangalorean is inappropriate. They have lot to improve on taste and fresh Ingredients (meat especially).
So people who want to try, surely u can but lower ur expectation. I don’t think i will ever visit. This assessment is based on me as a Mangalorean & food is no match to my native.",3,-1.6043956043956045

Went there on 27 Apr with friends. We ordered mutton and chicken biryani one each. The guy returned after 20 min to tell that chicken biryani is not available and can you change to mutton biryani instead which we agreed to. He returned again after around 3-4 min and said can you change again, we don't have mutton biryani and have only 1 chicken biryani. What really got us irritated was that just a few min ago he had mentioned that chicken Biryani is finished and then it magically appeared. We decided to cancel our order and return without having our lunch

Order A la carte
Booze all enjoyed

Cons : Service was not good , Couldn handle the crowd on Friday eve
People who ordered buffet are the losers

If you think you can invite 30 pax by ordering for 28 pax it’s definetly the wrong place

You have to order for 30 pax and invite 15 pax

And since ours was a bad experience am letting you all know

(The quantity was insufficient for big appetites )

If service (for some reason) could’nt remind of Mangalore,  the food definitely…. Blindfolded I can say couldn’t spot a difference of having delicious Mangalorean food in mangalore or in singapore. The food is to die for and took us straight to Mangalore. Right from Buns, to prawns ghee roast to Kori roti and finally Gadbad!!!!

The place was quite empty. The environs are clean and the staff is super friendly. We ordered the following :

1) Korri Rotti - I liked the gravy of the korri rotti, very similar to the one you get back home in Mangalore. The chicken, was a bit disappointing - chewy and seemed unfresh. Quantity was generous.

2) Anjal Tawa Fry - The masala for the tawa fry was really good, reminding me of home. The fish, however, didn't seem fresh.

3) Chicken Ghee Roast - Similar experience to the korri rotti and anjal tawa fry. Good masala and seasoning, but the chicken was too chewy and very little meat.

4) Buns - Took a take-away of Mangalore buns. Appropriately sweet and fluffy. Liked this.

5) Goli Bajje - Soft and crunchy golli bajje with coconut chutney.",0,1.4042553191489362

Food tastes good, after DTKR, I would say these guys have got the best seeraga samba Mutton Biryani. Mutton Biryani is full of flavour and the mutton is well cooked and is made in ghee so very aromatic. But the lower rating is because, they don't have proper chicken Biryani and they don't say that. they just pack a chicken piece in mutton biryani and send you away and if you have family members who don't like mutton, they can't eat the chicken biryani due to the mutton flavour and lot of small mutton pieces. And the chicken piece they put in the chicken Biryani is also dry and old. Not a good experience with takeaway..the mutton biryani like I said is a highlight. let's see next time.",0,2.814814814814815
